\title{Prior-Posterior Overlap Plot}
\usage{
ppo_plot(model, burn = 0, seq.length = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{List, usually output from \code{b_TPC()}. \code{ppo_plot} expects this list to have entries "samples", of class \code{mcmc} or \code{numeric} and "priors", with class \code{list} and entries that match the corresponding model parameters.}

\item{burn}{Integer, number of samples to discard as burn-in before creating prior-posterior overlap plot. Default is 0.}

\item{seq.length}{Integer, length of sequence used to evaluate prior density. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
Returns invisible(NULL) and creates a prior posterior overlap plot, with the prior density shown using a red line and the posterior density shown using a blue dashed line.
}
\description{
Create a prior-posterior overlap plot from output of \code{\link[=b_TPC]{b_TPC()}}.
}
\details{
Function to create a prior-posterior overlap plot. This is useful in determining the impact that the choice of prior distribution has on the analyses.
